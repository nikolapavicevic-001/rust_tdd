# Convention
Unit tests should be in same file as function.\
Integration test are located in tests folder.
# CI
CI will run when pull request has been made to development or main branch
# Tests
I am not sure if it is good practice to have multiple asserts in same case.\
Update 1: Should use parametrized test(rstest has [#case] macro), maybe some later exercise will correct this.
